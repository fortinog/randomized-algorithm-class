# Demos

- Vignette 1: a simple randomized SVD algorithm assuming exactly low-rank matrix
- Vignette 2: compare deterministic and randomized bubble and quicksorts
- Demo 3: compare different ways to compute the Frobenius norm of a matrix (in C)
- Demo 4: same as demo 3 but for sparse matrices (in Matlab). Comparse row vs column access
